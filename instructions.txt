Instructions:
-------------

1. Logos and other photos are located in the \images directory

2. Don't forget to use a favicon. You can create one in many ways.
   I recommend an online image converter such as
   https://www.favicon-generator.org/

3. Add authorized users to the "ldap.php" file:
   -----------------------------------------
   In "ldap.php" find the "// List of authorized users" section.
   Below that heading there will be a variable called "$authorized_users".
   Add any users that you want to have access to the IT Start Page to the array.

   For example, if you want aduser1, aduser2, and aduser3 to have access to the page
   modify the line to read:
   $authorized_users = array("aduser1", "aduser2", "aduser3");

4. Add your domain to the "ldap.php" file:
   ---------------------------------------
   In "ldap.php" find the "// What Domain are we connecting to?" section.
   Below that heading there will be two variables you will need to modify: $ldap and $domain.
